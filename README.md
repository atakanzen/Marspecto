# Marspecto
---
 A **Vue.js** project, that helps to search all of the photos that was taken on Mars by the NASA rovers.

Kudos to **[NASA{ APIs }](https://api.nasa.gov/)** for their awesome APIs.

- You can access almost all of the information about the rovers (Launch date, landing date, total photos etc.)
- You can search for photos by specifying Martian Sol for each rover.
- You can see all the photos that they took on the exact Sol that you've searched for.
